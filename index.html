            <h1>The idea of the Website </h1>
            <p>Ever since this assignment has been given I have not been able to think of a layout. I am still thinking of how I would want but it will be a while until I get there. The only thing I know for sure is I want  to screenshot each major update to the site so once it is constructed I can see the way it all came together.</p>
